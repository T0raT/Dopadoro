# Pomodoro? Dopedoro

We live in doom-scroller's society.

We are constantly bombarded with information, and it is easy to get lost in the noise.

Pomodoro is a simple technique that can help you focus on what matters most.

It is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals.

Traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

The idea is to work in focused sprints, followed by short breaks to recharge and refresh your mind.

## **_Just kidding, LOCK THE FUCK IN_**

But you don't got the time to fool around, your time is now.

You want dopamine, you're gonna work for it.

This timer will drip feed you dopamine... Like a hanging cake with a stick

You'll get to doom-scroll when you get YOUR SHIT **_DONE_**.

Do you task, you get dopecreds.

Use your dopecreds to exchange for that sweet sweet dopamine.
